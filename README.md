# H1B Visas Analysis (2011-2016)

## Introduction

This is an individual project using Python that analyzes the H1B visa applications submitted by companies based in the United States between 2011 and 2016. The dataset contains over 3 million rows and ten columns. The columns contain information on the visa applications, such as the type of job sponsored, the employer that sponsored the visa and the location where the employer is based. 

## Project Description

I performed this analysis for my Introduction to Data Mining class at The George Washington Univeristy. The requirement for the project was to perform data mining analysis on a complex dataset to find patterns and associations in order to draw meaningful conclusions and make predictions over time. I cleaned the data, conducted exploratory data analysis and created informative graphs and plot to gain and present important information and insights on the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle in November 2019, and it was originally scraped from the website of the U.S. Office of Foreign Labor by a Kaggle user (https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa).
